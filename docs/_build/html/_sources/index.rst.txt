MetroloPy, the docs
===================

tools for dealing with physical quantities:  uncertainty propagation and unit 
conversion


getting started
===============

MetroloPy is a pure python package and requires Python 3 and the 
`SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_ stack (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and IPython).  
It looks best in a `Jupyter notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`_.

Install MetroloPy with ``pip install metrolopy``  or 
``conda install -c conda-forge metrolopy``.

Physical quantities can then be represented in Python as `gummy`_ objects
with an uncertainty and (or) a unit:

MetroloPy can do much more including `Monte-Carlo uncertainty propagation`_, 
generating `uncertainty budget tables`_, and `curve fitting`_.  It can also handle 
`expanded uncertainties`_, `degrees of freedom`_, `correlated quantities`_, and 
`complex valued quantities`_.

the auto-generated docs (indices and tables)
============================================

These pages were automatically generated from the doc strings in the source
code.  They are slightly more comprehensive but perhaps slightly more confusing
than the handmade API docs referenced in the further reading section above.

* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`


Where did the name for the gummy class come from?
=================================================

The name comes from the 
`JGCM/ISO Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement <https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/guides/gum.html>`_ 
which is also known as the GUM.  The GUM is the international standard used by
metrology institutes and calibration labs for expressing and propagating 
measurement uncertainty.  The gummy object implements many of the 
recommendations outlined in the GUM.

Other references of note are the 
`draft 9th edition of the SI Brochure <https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/rev-si/#communication>`_ 
which contains the definitions of the SI units, and 
`NIST Special Publication 1038 <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication1038.pdf>`_ 
where many of the US customary units are defined.  Some physical constants
used for unit definitions are from the 
`2014 CODATA recommended values <http://www.codata.org/committees-and-groups/fundamental-physical-constants>`_
and the 
`IAU 2009 system of astronomical constants <http://maia.usno.navy.mil/NSFA/IAU2009_consts.html>`_.
