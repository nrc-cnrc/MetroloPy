    correlated and uses the auto-correlation of the set to find an effective 
    number of data points such that an estimate of the standard uncertainty is

    See [N.F. Zhang, Metrologia, 43, S276 (2006)] for details.

    If only one argument is given it is assumed that the argument represents
    an array of evenly spaced values.  This list may be a masked array, in
    which case the masked values are filled in with a linear interpolation.

    If two arguments are passed to n_eff, then it is assumed that the two
    arrays represent an array of x values followed by an array representing
    the corresponding y values of a set (x,y) points.  A cubic spline
    interpolation is used to get a set of evently spaced points.
